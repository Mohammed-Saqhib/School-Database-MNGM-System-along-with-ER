LAB PROGRAM
4. Create Sales table with the following fields( Sales No, Sales name, Branch, Sales amount, DOB)
1. Insert five records
1. Calculate total Sales amount in each branch
1. Calculate average Sales amount in each branch
1. Display all the salesmen, DOB who are born in the month of December as day in character format.
            Creating the table
create table sales(sales_no int primary key,sales_name varchar(50),branch varchar(50),sales_amount decimal(10,2),dob date);


  





1. Inserting tuples 


insert into sales values (1,'alice','New York',5000.00,'1990-12-15');
       insert into sales values (2,'Bob','Las Vegas',3000.00,'1985-12-15');
       insert into sales values (3,'Charlie','Chicago',7000.00,'1995-11-17');
            insert into sales values (4,'David','New York',6000.00,'1995-03-17');
            insert into sales values (5,'Tia','LA',4000.00,'2002-03-17');
        
2. select branch,sum(sales_amount) as total_sales_amount from sales group by branch;


  





3. select branch,avg(sales_amount) as average_sales_amount from sales group by branch;


  




4. select sales_name,  date_format(dob, '%w %d %m %y') as Birth_Day from sales where month(dob) = 12;
